# Sound
## What tones, sounds, settings make sense given your data? How do different choices affect the meaning of what youâ€™ve created? Is there anything meaningful? 
- I guess that the whatever setting you choose would affect the way that the data is perceived, in my instance, I used the Ontario covidtesting.csv file and from that I Used the "Under Investigation" column, and I'm not really sure why I chose the settings that i did, they just seemed to sound right for it. At least for me, I can't seem to feel like there is anything meaningful there. I'm not sure if that's just me, but I can't seem to get anything meaningful out it. Maybe that shows that certain things that work for some people in representing digital history might not work for others which would be understandable as pretty much anything representative of something could hold great meaning for one person, whilst at the same time being completely meaningless to another. 
- Most likely the setting used would affect the tone of what is produced and subsequent how the music seems or makes someone feel, like darker sounding instruments and lower notes for darker topics, and lighter notes and instruments for lighter topic. However, combining dark subject matter with lighter notes and instruments is probably a bad idea.

- I really like this as a way of explaining certain histories primarily of people or groups of people. Puts into context the places that they go and the period of time that they live there. Especially in the case of Bass Reeves, who seemingly moved around in almost a square shape during his life. I think this is a great tool as it works well as a visual aide and puts into perspective the movements of whoever its covering. This presumably also works well for explaining events that take place across great distances like a war or something as it would also help the viewer by giving the geographical context as to where events were taking place. 

## Webmapping with Leaftlet

### Do you see how you could recenter the map on Ottawa? Add some more data? Change the base map to another style?
- The center point of the map can be changed in the point-data.geojson and more data presumably can be added by adding another feature geojson object into the point-data.geojson file. As for changing the style, I would assume that can be done in the index.html page, maybe in the input parameter to the tileLayer function.
### Human failures
- Could seem to start a http server using the command line, took me a few minutes to realise that I was using the regular windows command prompt instead of the anaconda powershell.
### Link to rectified map

- Not sure if was something I did, the technology or the map that I chose, but it seemed to be slightly off in most areas. Upon reflection however, it is unfair to compare a map done by hand to a satellite image in terms of accuracy. Additionally, it is obvious that there are very few unchanged landmarks in the map to base the points off of and using points on land is questionable given the difference between the representations in terms of location and shape on the old map compared to the satellite image.

### Human / Technological Failures
- Neither index2.html nor index3.html worked after making the changes required for index2.html. Only the background appeared with none of the rest of the stuff appearing and no error codes or warnings being produced in the command prompt or the developer console. Couldn't seem to fix it and forgot to ask about it.

## Poster
- Creating the poster went off, seemingly without a hitch, but I still haven't gotten the hang of Inkscape, yet and I doubt I ever will. However, a bad worker shouldn't blame his tools and I admit that Inkscape is a rather powerful image editor that I don't fully understand, which when combined with my lack of artistic talent leads to what I have produced which is rather awful. 

## Static Website
- Created the static website, although even after reading the provided tutorial, I couldn't get the _post bit to work so I opted to just paste the content of my journal entries into my static website.
