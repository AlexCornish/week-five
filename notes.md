# Sound
## What tones, sounds, settings make sense given your data? How do different choices affect the meaning of what youâ€™ve created? Is there anything meaningful? 
- I guess that the whatever setting you choose would affect the way that the data is perceived, in my instance, I used the Ontario covidtesting.csv file and from that I Used the "Under Investigation" column, and I'm not really sure why I chose the settings that i did, they just seemed to sound right for it. At least for me, I can't seem to feel like there is anything meaningful there. I'm not sure if that's just me, but I can't seem to get anything meaningful out it. Maybe that shows that certain things that work for some people in representing digital history might not work for others which would be understandable as pretty much anything representative of something could hold great meaning for one person, whilst at the same time being completely meaningless to another. 
- Most likely the setting used would affect the tone of what is produced and subsequent how the music seems or makes someone feel, like darker sounding instruments and lower notes for darker topics, and lighter notes and instruments for lighter topic. However, combining dark subject matter with lighter notes and instruments is probably a bad idea.
